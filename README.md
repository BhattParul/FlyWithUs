# FlyWithUs
Project to check flight status


Details about the project:

User can use our website to check the flights’ status. The home page shows five recent arriving and departing flights. The ‘flights’ tab shows multiple subtabs. It shows all the flights sorted by either time or airlines. It shows all the flights for each airline. It also shows all the connected flights.
The extra feature is having a login system with different privileges. Users can be admin/non-admin. Non-admin users can login to see if he/she has flight or not and checking in to get a boarding number while admins can login to update flight times/ delete staff members and use some more queries for checking some basic information about the flights and passengers. These features will only be appeared once the user logs in.


How to Run:

•	Extract everything under xampp/htdocs as a folder "flywithus" which would have all the files.
•	 Make a database named 'flywithus' in your localhost/phpMyAdmin.
•	Run it as localhost/flywithus.
